          You get your SOL back, plus any SOL from people who didn't check-in on

        I hacked this together over a few days, mostly at the Miami Hacker
        House. I had fun, learned a lot, and met some great people. While party
        <b>IRL</b> shouldn't be deployed to mainnet (the code's a mess, and
        you'll probably lose all your money), it helped me realize chewing glass
        wasn't so bad after all. I'd say that's a win.
